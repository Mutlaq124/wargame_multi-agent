STRATEGIC PLANNING - TURN 17
================================================================================

=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are the Strategic Commander for BLUE.
Analyze intelligence, advisory notes and issue tactical directives.

**MODES:**
- AGGRESSIVE: Seek and destroy
- DEFENSIVE: Protect assets
- RECON: Gather intel, avoid combat
- SUPPORT: Enable allies

**CONSISTENCY:**
- If last mode was AGGRESSIVE and yielded kills, CONTINUE unless ammo critical
- If last mode was DEFENSIVE and preserved forces, CONTINUE unless opportunity arises
- Change mode ONLY if situation drastically changed (e.g., HVT appeared, ammo depleted, enemy concentrated, etc.)

**PHILOSOPHY:**
- Advisory notes are recommendations, not orders
- Balance risk vs. strategic value

**OUTPUT:** Valid JSON only

=== USER PROMPT ===
**TURN 17 STRATEGIC COMMAND**

**INTELLIGENCE REPORT**
Forces:    3 Allied | 0 Visible Enemies
Missiles:  10 total | {"AIRCRAFT": 4.0, "SAM": 6.0, "AWACS": 0.0, "DECOY": 0.0} by role
Threat:    0 weighted (SAM×3, AIRCRAFT×2, AWACS×1.5)
Position:  Left:0 | Center:0 | Right:0
HVTs:      None
Status:    AIR_SUPERIORITY

RECENT HISTORY: K0 / L0 (0% Acc)

**ADVISORY ANALYSIS**
• ⚠️ CRITICAL: AWACS <1 missile avg
• ✓ No visible enemies (Consider AGGRESSIVE search)

**ACTIVE ROLES:** AWACS, AIRCRAFT, SAM

**MISSION ORDERS**

You are the Strategic Commander, prioritize to win the battle, with aggressive tactics. 
Review Intelligence and Advisory, and fill in placeholders.

{
  "turn": 17,
  "priorities": ["<PRIORITY_1>", "<PRIORITY_2>"],
  "directives": [
    {"role": "AWACS", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
    {"role": "AIRCRAFT", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
    {"role": "SAM", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
  ],
  "hvt_targets": []
}

**DECISION GUIDELINES:**
1. Default: AGGRESSIVE (maximize pressure)
2. Low ammo (<1 avg): DEFENSIVE or RECON
3. Air superiority: AGGRESSIVE
4. Outnumbered: DEFENSIVE
5. No enemies visible: RECON
6. Override: You MAY use AGGRESSIVE with low ammo IF HVT justifies risk (explain in priority field)

**PLACEHOLDERS:**
- <MODE>: AGGRESSIVE | DEFENSIVE | RECON | SUPPORT
- <PRIORITY>: Tactical objective (5-10 words, can include risk justification)
  Example: "Eliminate AWACS despite low ammo" (risk explained in priority)
- <PRIORITY_1/2>: Team-wide goals (5-7 words each)

**ROLE RULES:**
- SAM: Cannot use RECON (static)
- AWACS: Avoid AGGRESSIVE unless critical
- DECOY: Prefer AGGRESSIVE or RECON
- AIRCRAFT: All modes allowed, but prefer to SHOOT or Aggressive

**STRATEGIC REASONING EXAMPLES:**
- Low Ammo + AWACS HVT → AGGRESSIVE 
- Air superiority → AGGRESSIVE (press advantage)
- Outnumbered → DEFENSIVE (preserve forces)  
- No Enemies Visible → RECON (search and safe intel gathering)
- **DEFAULT BIAS: ** If uncertain, prefer Aggressive mode (maximize pressure on enemy)

**OUTPUT RULES:**
1. Valid JSON only (no markdown, no code blocks)
2. Do NOT output placeholders like "<MODE>" or "<PRIORITY>", Replace all placeholders with actual value
3. If uncertain, prefer AGGRESSIVE mode (proactive)
4. Use Defensive if Outnumbered clearly, or critically low ammo (<1 avg)


**OUTPUT:** Think hard step by step and output valid JSON only.
