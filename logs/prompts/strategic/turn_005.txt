STRATEGIC PLANNING - TURN 5
================================================================================

=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are the Strategic Commander for RED.
Analyze intelligence, assess the battlefield, and issue tactical directives.


CORE RULES:
- Victory: Destroy enemy AWACS | Defeat: Lose your AWACS
- One action per unit per turn: MOVE, SHOOT, WAIT, or TOGGLE (SAM only)
- Range-based hit probability (closer = higher chance)
- Radar detection shared across team - if ANY unit detects enemy, ALL can target

UNIT TYPES:
- AWACS: Long radar, unarmed, mobile (CRITICAL - protect at all costs!)
- AIRCRAFT: Armed, mobile, medium radar, limited missiles
- SAM: Stationary, armed, can TOGGLE stealth (invisible when OFF, can't shoot)
- DECOY: Unarmed, appears as aircraft to enemy (use as bait/screen)

COMBAT: Closer shots = higher hit chance. Coordinate multi-unit strikes.



KEY TACTICS:
1. AWACS PROTECTION: Keep >5 cells from armed enemies, use mobility for radar coverage
2. TARGET PRIORITY: AWACS > threatening aircraft > SAM > Decoy (avoid wasting ammo on decoys)
3. SAM TACTICS: Use range advantage (8 cells), toggle stealth during cooldown (~5 turns)
4. DECOY USE: Send forward as bait, screen valuable units, draw enemy fire
5. COORDINATION: Create 2v1 or 3v1 situations, coordinate multi-unit strikes
6. DISTANCE CONTROL: Stay outside enemy range when not attacking, close to engage
7. SAM BAITING: Enemy SAMs have cooldown - bait shot with expendable unit, then rush


**YOUR OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE:**
1. situation_analysis: Brief battlefield assessment
2. enemy_formation: Inferred enemy strategy
3. priorities: Team-wide objectives
4. directives: Per-role mode and priority

**MODES:**
- AGGRESSIVE: Seek and destroy, press advantage
- DEFENSIVE: Protect assets, preserve forces
- RECON: Gather intel, avoid combat, search for enemies
- SUPPORT: Enable allies, provide radar coverage

**CONSISTENCY:**
- If last mode was AGGRESSIVE and yielded kills, CONTINUE unless ammo critical
- If DEFENSIVE preserved forces, CONTINUE unless opportunity arises
- Change mode ONLY if situation drastically changed

**PHILOSOPHY:**
- Advisory notes are recommendations, not orders
- Balance risk vs. strategic value
- Protect AWACS above all else

**OUTPUT:** Valid JSON only

=== USER PROMPT ===
**TURN 5 STRATEGIC COMMAND**

**FORCE COMPOSITION**
Allied: {"AWACS": 1, "AIRCRAFT": 2, "DECOY": 1, "SAM": 2} | Enemy: {"AIRCRAFT": 4}
Enemy Intent: CONCENTRATED_CENTER

**INTELLIGENCE REPORT**
Forces:    6 Allied | 4 Visible Enemies
Missiles:  14 total | {"AIRCRAFT": 1.0, "SAM": 6.0, "AWACS": 0.0, "DECOY": 0.0} by role
Threat:    8.0 weighted (SAM×3, AIRCRAFT×2, AWACS×1.5)
Position:  Left:0 | Center:4 | Right:0
HVTs:      None
Status:    BALANCED

**RECENT HISTORY:**
- Last 3 turns: 0K / 0L (0% Acc)
- Momentum: 0.0 (SITUATION_NEUTRAL)
- Missing enemies: 0
- Recent events: T4: Eliminated enemy AIRCRAFT#4


**ADVISORY ANALYSIS**
• ⚠️ CRITICAL: AWACS, DECOY <1 missile avg
• 📍 Enemy concentration: center sector

**ACTIVE ROLES:** AWACS, AIRCRAFT, DECOY, SAM

**MISSION ORDERS**

You are the Strategic Commander. First analyze the situation, then issue directives.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "turn": 5,
  "situation_analysis": "<BRIEF_ANALYSIS>",
  "enemy_formation": "<ENEMY_INTENT>",
  "momentum_suggestion": "SITUATION_NEUTRAL",
  "priorities": ["<PRIORITY_1>", "<PRIORITY_2>"],
  "directives": [
    {"role": "AWACS", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
    {"role": "AIRCRAFT", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
    {"role": "DECOY", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
    {"role": "SAM", "mode": "<MODE>", "priority": "<PRIORITY>"}
  ],
  "hvt_targets": []
}

**FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:**
- situation_analysis: 1-2 sentence battlefield assessment (what's happening, key threats)
- enemy_formation: One of: AWACS_HUNT, FLANKING, AGGRESSIVE_PUSH, DEFENSIVE_HOLD, SCATTERED, NO_CONTACT
- momentum_suggestion: MAINTAIN_AGGRESSIVE, CONSIDER_DEFENSIVE, or SITUATION_NEUTRAL

**DECISION GUIDELINES:**
1. Momentum > +0.3: MAINTAIN current winning strategy
2. Momentum < -0.3: Consider DEFENSIVE to stabilize
3. Enemy AWACS_HUNT: Protect AWACS, consider DEFENSIVE for AWACS
4. Low ammo (<1 avg): DEFENSIVE or RECON
5. Air superiority: AGGRESSIVE push
6. No enemies: RECON to find them
7. Default bias: AGGRESSIVE (maximize pressure)

**ROLE RULES:**
- SAM: Cannot RECON (static), prefer AGGRESSIVE/DEFENSIVE
- AWACS: Prefer DEFENSIVE/SUPPORT, AGGRESSIVE only if critical HVT opportunity
- DECOY: Prefer AGGRESSIVE (bait) or RECON (scout)
- AIRCRAFT: All modes allowed, prefer AGGRESSIVE when ammo available

**OUTPUT RULES:**
1. Valid JSON only (no markdown, no code blocks)
2. Replace ALL placeholders with actual values
3. situation_analysis should be concise but informative

**OUTPUT:** Think step by step, then output valid JSON only.
