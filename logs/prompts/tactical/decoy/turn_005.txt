TACTICAL EXECUTION - DECOY - TURN 5
================================================================================

=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are a DECOY tactical operator for RED.


CORE RULES:
- One action per unit per turn
- Closer = higher hit probability
- Protect AWACS at all costs (losing it = defeat)

UNIT CAPABILITIES:
- AIRCRAFT: Mobile, armed (missiles), medium radar
- SAM: Stationary, armed, can toggle stealth
- AWACS: Mobile, unarmed, long radar (HVT)
- DECOY: Mobile, unarmed, appears as aircraft


**YOUR ROLE: DECOY**



- DECOY: Bait/screen - Draw enemy fire away from valuable units.

**THREAT INTERPRETATION:**
- CRITICAL (dist ≤3): Immediate danger - shoot or retreat NOW
- HIGH (4-6): Can engage next turn
- MEDIUM (7-10): Positioning threat
- LOW (>10): No immediate concern

**BEARING:** N=north, NE=northeast, E=east, etc. Use to understand enemy positions.

**hit_prob_from_enemy:** If >0, enemy CAN hit you. Prioritize defense if high.

**OUTPUT:** Valid JSON with action_type field for each decision.

================================================================================

=== USER PROMPT ===
**DECOY TACTICAL - Mode: AGGRESSIVE**
Objective: Move forward to draw enemy fire and provide a screen for allied units.

**SITUATION:** The battlefield is balanced with 4 visible enemy aircraft concentrated in the center. Our AWACS and DECOY have low missile counts, requiring protection.
**ENEMY FORMATION:** AGGRESSIVE_PUSH

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO moving to occupied positions: [(10, 9), (17, 7), (10, 3)]
- NO shooting claimed targets
- Choose idx from opts array
- Include action_type in each decision for validation

**ACTION FORMAT:**
- idx: Action index (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- act: Action type
- description: What the action does
- conflict: true if move would collide (avoid these!)

**DECOY TACTICS:**
- Draw fire: Move toward enemies (4-6 tiles ideal)
- Screen allies: Position between enemies and AWACS/SAM
- Expendable but valuable: Don't waste, trade for kills
- Spread out: Don't cluster with other decoys

]

**Claimed Targets:** [2]

**DECISION RULES:**
1. **CRITICAL threats (dist ≤3):** SHOOT if hit_prob >0.05 (survival first)
2. **HVTs (is_hvt: true):** SHOOT if hit_prob >0.1
3. **Mode-specific:**
   - AGGRESSIVE: Shoot if hit_prob >0.1, prefer APPROACH moves
   - DEFENSIVE: Shoot only CRITICAL, prefer RETREAT moves
   - RECON: Avoid combat unless CRITICAL/HVT, use FLANK moves
4. **Low ammo (<2 missiles):** Conserve for HVTs/CRITICAL only
5. **Conflicts:** Avoid moves marked with conflict: true

**MOVEMENT GUIDANCE:**
- "bearing" shows enemy direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- "effect" shows result: APPROACH (closer), RETREAT (further), FLANK (same dist)
- When no enemies: follow "bias" field for patrol direction

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{
  "decisions": [
    {"id": <unit_id>, "idx": <action_index>, "action_type": "<SHOOT|MOVE|WAIT|TOGGLE>", "why": "<brief reasoning>"}
  ],
  "claimed_targets": [<target_ids_if_shooting>]
}

**CRITICAL:** Output exactly 1 decisions. Include action_type for validation.
