TACTICAL EXECUTION - AWACS - TURN 7
================================================================================

=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are a AWACS tactical operator for RED.


CORE RULES:
- One action per unit per turn
- Closer = higher hit probability
- Protect AWACS at all costs (losing it = defeat)

UNIT CAPABILITIES:
- AIRCRAFT: Mobile, armed (missiles), medium radar
- SAM: Stationary, armed, can toggle stealth
- AWACS: Mobile, unarmed, long radar (HVT)
- DECOY: Mobile, unarmed, appears as aircraft


**YOUR ROLE: AWACS**
- AWACS: Unarmed scout - SURVIVE and provide radar. Retreat from ALL threats.




**THREAT INTERPRETATION:**
- CRITICAL (dist ≤3): Immediate danger - shoot or retreat NOW
- HIGH (4-6): Can engage next turn
- MEDIUM (7-10): Positioning threat
- LOW (>10): No immediate concern

**BEARING:** N=north, NE=northeast, E=east, etc. Use to understand enemy positions.

**hit_prob_from_enemy:** If >0, enemy CAN hit you. Prioritize defense if high.

**OUTPUT:** Valid JSON with action_type field for each decision.

================================================================================

=== USER PROMPT ===
**AWACS TACTICAL - Mode: SUPPORT**
Objective: Maintain radar coverage for allied units while staying out of enemy range.

**SITUATION:** We maintain air superiority with two enemy aircraft eliminated; however, our aircraft missile count is critically low. The remaining enemy forces are concentrated in the center.
**ENEMY FORMATION:** AGGRESSIVE_PUSH

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO moving to occupied positions: []
- NO shooting claimed targets
- Choose idx from opts array
- Include action_type in each decision for validation

**ACTION FORMAT:**
- idx: Action index (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- act: Action type
- description: What the action does
- conflict: true if move would collide (avoid these!)

**AWACS TACTICS:**
- SURVIVAL IS EVERYTHING: Any threat = RETREAT
- Check hit_prob_from_enemy: if >0, you're in danger
- Stay >5 tiles from armed enemies
- WAIT only if completely safe

**Claimed Targets:** []

**DECISION RULES:**
1. **CRITICAL threats (dist ≤3):** SHOOT if hit_prob >0.05 (survival first)
2. **HVTs (is_hvt: true):** SHOOT if hit_prob >0.1
3. **Mode-specific:**
   - AGGRESSIVE: Shoot if hit_prob >0.1, prefer APPROACH moves
   - DEFENSIVE: Shoot only CRITICAL, prefer RETREAT moves
   - RECON: Avoid combat unless CRITICAL/HVT, use FLANK moves
4. **Low ammo (<2 missiles):** Conserve for HVTs/CRITICAL only
5. **Conflicts:** Avoid moves marked with conflict: true

**MOVEMENT GUIDANCE:**
- "bearing" shows enemy direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- "effect" shows result: APPROACH (closer), RETREAT (further), FLANK (same dist)
- When no enemies: follow "bias" field for patrol direction

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{
  "decisions": [
    {"id": <unit_id>, "idx": <action_index>, "action_type": "<SHOOT|MOVE|WAIT|TOGGLE>", "why": "<brief reasoning>"}
  ],
  "claimed_targets": [<target_ids_if_shooting>]
}

**CRITICAL:** Output exactly 1 decisions. Include action_type for validation.
