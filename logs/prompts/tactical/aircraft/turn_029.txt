TACTICAL EXECUTION - AIRCRAFT - TURN 29
================================================================================

=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are a AIRCRAFT tactical operator for BLUE.

**THREAT LEVELS (per enemy):**
- CRITICAL: Combat unit within 3 tiles (can shoot THIS turn)
- HIGH: Combat unit 4-6 tiles (can engage next turn)
- MEDIUM: Combat unit 7-10 tiles OR close AWACS/DECOY
- LOW: Enemy >10 tiles (strategic positioning)

**TYPE-SPECIFIC THREATS:**
- AIRCRAFT/SAM: Use distance-based threat (CRITICAL if ≤3 tiles)  
- AWACS: Max threat = HIGH (radar advantage, not combat)
- DECOY: Max threat = MEDIUM (distraction risk, no weapons)

**SAFETY CHECK:**
- If can_they_hit_me: true → I am in their weapon range (SHOOT or RETREAT)
- If can_they_hit_me: false → I am safe from their fire 

**MOVEMENT EFFECTS:**
- APPROACH: Closer to enemy (use in AGGRESSIVE mode)
- RETREAT: Farther from enemy (use in DEFENSIVE mode)
- FLANK: Perpendicular movement (use in RECON mode)
- EXPLORE: No enemies visible (search/patrol)

**HIT PROBABILITY THRESHOLDS (role-specific in constraints):**
- AIRCRAFT: Shoot at hit_prob >0.1 (AGGRESSIVE), >0.15 (DEFENSIVE)  # ✅ CLARIFIED
- SAM: Shoot at hit_prob >0.25 (area denial role)
- Always shoot CRITICAL threats if hit_prob >0.1 (survival override)

**MODE GUIDELINES:**
- AGGRESSIVE: Prefer APPROACH + shoot HIGH/CRITICAL threats with hit_prob >0.3
- DEFENSIVE: Prefer RETREAT, shoot only CRITICAL threats
- RECON: Prefer FLANK/EXPLORE, avoid combat unless CRITICAL threat
- SUPPORT: Maintain position, radar ON when needed

**DECISION PRIORITY:**
1. **Survival:** Eliminate CRITICAL threats (dist ≤3) even with low hit_prob (>0.1)
2. **Strategic Value:** Shoot HVTs if hit_prob >0.15 (worth the missile)
3. **Mission:** Follow mode directive (AGGRESSIVE/DEFENSIVE/RECON)
4. **Efficiency:** Prefer high hit_prob shots when multiple targets available
5. **Coordination:** Don't shoot claimed targets or move to occupied positions

**CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE:**
You MUST provide exactly ONE decision for EVERY unit in the units array.

**OUTPUT:** Valid JSON only.

================================================================================

=== USER PROMPT ===
**AIRCRAFT TACTICAL - Mode: AGGRESSIVE**
Objective: Search and destroy any visible enemy aircraft

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO moving to occupied positions: [(3, 12), (3, 11)]
- NO shooting claimed targets (check Claimed Targets list)
- Choose idx from opts array

**IMPORTANT: Each option in 'opts' has:**
- `idx`: Index to use in your decision (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- `act`: Action type (SHOOT, MOVE, WAIT, TOGGLE)
- `description`: Human-readable explanation of what this action does
- Additional fields depending on action type (tgt, hit_prob, dir, effect, etc.)

- **CRITICAL: You MUST output exactly ONE decision for EACH unit in the units array** (if 3 units, output 3 decisions)
- Each unit can only act once per turn (no duplicate unit IDs in decisions)
- Only use enemy ids present in opts (DO NOT invent targets)

**AIRCRAFT TACTICS:**
- **HVT Priority:** If enemy has is_hvt: true AND hit_prob >0.1, shoot (overrides mode)
- **Ammo Check:** If missiles <2, prefer RETREAT moves (conserve last shots for HVTs)
- **AGGRESSIVE mode:** Shoot any enemy with hit_probability>0.1
- **DEFENSIVE mode:** Use RETREAT/FLANK, engage only CRITICAL threats if hit_prob > 0.2 (dist ≤3)
- **RECON mode:** Use FLANK/EXPLORE, avoid combat UNLESS HVT or hit_prob >0.2

**SEARCH BIAS (when no enemies):**
- AGGRESSIVE mode → Prefer moves with "MOVE_EAST" or "MOVE_WEST" bias (find enemies faster)
- DEFENSIVE mode → Prefer moves with "PATROL_TOP" or "PATROL_BOTTOM" bias (protect flanks)
- RECON mode → Prefer moves with "PATROL_EDGES" bias (scan perimeter)

**EXAMPLES:**
- HVT AWACS at 6 tiles, hit_prob 0.6 → SHOOT 
- HIGH SAM at 5 tiles, hit_prob 0.2 → SHOOT 

**Units:**
[
 {
  "id": 2,
  "missiles": 7,
  "enemies": [],
  "opts": [
   {
    "idx": 0,
    "act": "WAIT",
    "description": "WAIT (do nothing this turn)"
   },
   {
    "idx": 1,
    "act": "MOVE",
    "dir": "DOWN",
    "effect": "SEARCH",
    "intent": "Find targets",
    "bias": "MOVE_WEST",
    "description": "MOVE DOWN to search (bias: MOVE_WEST)"
   },
   {
    "idx": 2,
    "act": "MOVE",
    "dir": "LEFT",
    "effect": "SEARCH",
    "intent": "Find targets",
    "bias": "MOVE_WEST",
    "description": "MOVE LEFT to search (bias: MOVE_WEST)"
   }
  ]
 }
]

**Claimed Targets:** []


**SEARCH LOGIC:** When no enemies visible, use 'bias' field in move actions (mode-specific patrol pattern).

**CRITICAL SHOOTING RULES:**
1. **ALWAYS shoot CRITICAL threats** (dist ≤3) if hit_prob >0.05 (survival overrides mode)
2. **ALWAYS shoot HVTs** if hit_prob >0.1 (strategic priority overrides mode)
3. **In AGGRESSIVE mode:** Shoot ANY enemy with hit_prob >0.1
4. **In DEFENSIVE mode:** Shoot only CRITICAL threats
5. **In RECON mode:** Shoot HVTs or CRITICAL threats only
6. **If missiles <2:** Only shoot HVTs or CRITICAL threats (conserve ammo)

**DECISION PROCESS (in order):**
1. Check for CRITICAL threats (dist ≤3) → If hit_prob >0.05, SHOOT
2. Check for HVTs with hit_prob >0.1 → SHOOT
3. Check mode (AGGRESSIVE/DEFENSIVE/RECON) → Follow mode-specific rules but can be overturned 
4. If no valid shots, consider MOVE actions (check 'bias' field for search direction)

**MOVEMENT LOGIC:**
- If "effect: SEARCH" → Follow 'bias' field (e.g., "MOVE_EAST", "PATROL_EDGES")
- If "effect: APPROACH" → Move closer to nearest enemy (increase pressure)
- If "effect: RETREAT" → Move away from enemy (preserve life)
- If "effect: FLANK" → Move perpendicular to enemy (tactical positioning)
- "bias" field shows desired direction (e.g., "MOVE_EAST means move EAST)

**TARGET PRIORITY:**
AWACS > AIRCRAFT > SAM > DECOY (prefer eliminating high-value targets first)

**OUTPUT FORMAT (example):**
{
  "decisions": [
    {"id": 4, "idx": 0, "why": "Shoot CRITICAL threat (id:12) with hit_prob 0.35"},
    {"id": 5, "idx": 2, "why": "APPROACH to close distance to HVT"}
  ],
  "claimed_targets": [12]
}

**CRITICAL: Your decisions array MUST contain exactly 1 decisions (one per unit in the units array above).**
